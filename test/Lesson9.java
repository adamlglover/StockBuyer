public class Lesson9 {

 // This class will explain for loops

// format
for(variable; condition; iteration)
      // execute

// example
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      System.out.println("i is now" + i);

// output
1 i is now 1
2 i is now 2
3 i is now 3
4 i is now 4
5 i is now 5
6 i is now 6
7 i is now 7
8 i is now 8
9 i is now 9
10 i is now 10 


// weird for loop 
int x = 9;
for(int i = x; i < x; x++)
